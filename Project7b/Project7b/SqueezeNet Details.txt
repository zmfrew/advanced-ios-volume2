**Changes Required**

The train_valid.prototxt needs to be updated for deployment. To do so, the following changes are required:

1. The data layer should be replaced by an input layer with dimensions equal to the crop size in the data layer.
2. The accuracy layers from the end of the prototxt file need to be deleted as they are not required during
   deployment. They can remain in the prototxt but they will be ignored.
3. The loss layer will be ignored, and a layer of type softmax is required to be added, with bottom layer as
   pool10 and top as "prob"
4. In the conversion call, the biases provided in the train_valid data layer are required to be given as arguments
